# Fraudulent Transaction Detection

An unsupervised fraud-triage demonstration using behavioral transaction features and two anomaly detectors.

## Project status

- **Portfolio decision:** Maintained — existing executed notebook retained
- **Learning type:** Unsupervised learning
- **Core method:** Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor
- **Execution:** Notebook executed successfully with outputs committed

## Problem statement

The project demonstrates how patterns, similarities, communities, or anomalies can be discovered without using a prediction target during model fitting. Results are interpreted as exploratory signals rather than ground truth.

## Dataset

The maintained notebook uses deterministic synthetic transactions with injected anomalies for post-hoc evaluation. The scenario labels are not used to fit the detectors.

The notebook documents its data contract, reproducible seed, quality checks, and any synthetic proxy labels used only for retrospective diagnostics.

Interpretation, visualization, and limitations
```

## Evaluation

The notebook uses method-appropriate evidence such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, cluster stability, retrieval similarity, graph structure, anomaly-score diagnostics, and post-hoc synthetic checks. No demo result is presented as a production benchmark.

## How to run

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r "Unsupervised Learning Projects/requirements.txt"
jupyter lab "Unsupervised Learning Projects/Fraudulent Transaction Detection/Anomaly Detection.ipynb"
```

Run the notebook from top to bottom. Saved outputs are included for review.

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Jupyter

## Responsible use

Discovered groups and anomaly flags do not establish identity, intent, causality, risk, or business impact. Production use requires domain review, representative data, privacy controls, monitoring, and decision-specific evaluation.
